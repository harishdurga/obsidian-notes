#### What is Algebra?
Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with solving equations and studying the relationships between variables. It involves using letters (usually represented by symbols like x, y, or a) to represent unknown quantities, and numbers to represent known values.

#### What is Linear Algebra?
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with studying and solving problems related to linear relationships between numbers. It helps us understand how things can be scaled, added, or subtracted from each other.

#### What is a Linear Relation
A linear relation, also known as a linear relationship, is a mathematical connection between two variables that can be expressed as a straight line on a graph. In simple terms, it describes a situation where one variable changes at a constant rate with respect to another variable.
Mathematically, a linear relationship between two variables, let's say x and y, can be represented by the equation:
```
y = mx + b
```
Where:
- y is the dependent variable (the one we want to predict or understand).
- x is the independent variable (the one we can control or change).
- m is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change between y and x.
- b is the y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is 0.

>In linear algebra there can be only one, zero, or infinite solutions. And Impossible to have finite multiple solutions.



In Linear algebra, when solving for unknowns, there will be only three possibilities for solution.
- Only one solution 
- Infinite solutions
- No solution at all
Finite multiple solutions are not possible.

	<p>
		a "vector" refers to a mathematical object that represents a quantity or value that has both magnitude and direction. For example, if we plot a graph, the line we draw will have certain length and direction.
