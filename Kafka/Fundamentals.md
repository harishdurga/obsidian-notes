<p style="color:#ff0048;font-size:30px">What is Kafka?</p>
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to publish, store, and process streams of data in a scalable and reliable way. In simple terms, you can think of Kafka as a giant message bus that enables different applications and systems to talk to each other and exchange data.

Imagine you have multiple applications in your computer system, like a web server, a database, and a mobile app. These applications generate data all the time, such as website logs, user interactions, or database updates.

Kafka acts as a central hub that collects all this data from different sources and stores it in a sequence, like a queue. This data queue is known as a "topic" in Kafka. Each topic can have multiple "producers" (applications that send data to the topic) and "consumers" (applications that read data from the topic).

The interesting part is that Kafka can handle a massive amount of data, and it's designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It can scale to handle data from thousands of sources and process it efficiently.

With Kafka, you can also replay the data from the past, which is useful for tasks like data analytics, real-time monitoring, and building event-driven systems.

In summary, Kafka acts as a reliable and scalable messaging system that helps different parts of a computer system communicate and share data in a seamless and efficient way. It plays a crucial role in modern data architectures and is widely used for various purposes, including data integration, real-time data processing, and event-driven architectures.


> [!faq]- Is Kafka a database for storing structured data like SQL databases?
> No, Kafka is not a database. It is a distributed streaming platform that focuses on handling streams of data, providing features like pub/sub messaging and stream processing.

### Terminology
<p><span style="color:#bb6be3;font-size:20px">Broker:</span> A single Kafka server or node that stores and manages the data streams and topics.</p>


<p><span style="color:#bb6be3;font-size:20px">Topic:</span> A category or stream name to which records are published. Producers write data to topics, and consumers read data from topics.</p>


<p><span style="color:#bb6be3;font-size:20px">Partition:</span> Each topic can be divided into multiple partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and distribution in Kafka.</p>
